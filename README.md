# Messing around with endeavour / i3 setup

i've never used an arch based distro in my life
so i don't recommend using any of this

rofi theme: [squared nord](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection)



TO DO:

add icons to rofi: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rofi

make polybar less ugly
